# Casino-Guessing-Number
This is a simple C++ code for a number guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 and the player has to guess the number. The player will be prompted to enter a guess, and the program will tell the player whether the guess is too high or too low. The game will continue until the player guesses the right number.
